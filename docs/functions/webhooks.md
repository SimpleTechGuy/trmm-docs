To apply and run on Agent overdue and Check/Task failures use [Alert Templates](alerting.md#alert-action-settings)

`Name`: Name

`Description`: for notes about webhook.

`URL Pattern`: For webhooks, you need a URL where the Tactical RMM can send HTTP requests when an event occurs. This URL should be a server endpoint configured to accept HTTP requests.

### Request Headers

Request headers allow the server to learn more about the request context. Here are some common headers used in webhook configurations:

Content-Type: Describes the nature of the data being sent. For JSON data, you use application/json.

Authorization: If your endpoint requires authentication, you might use a token or other credentials in this header.

User-Agent: Identifies the application making the request.

```json
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Request Body

The request body must contain valid JSON and can include anything you want. Here are some examples:

=== ":simple-discord: Discord"

    Discord: Edit a channel > Integrations > Webhooks

    ```json
    {
        "content": "Agent hasn't checked in for {{agent.overdue_time}} minutes.",
        "username": "{{agent.hostname}}",
        "avatar_url": "https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/PogChamp.png",
        "embeds": [
            {
                "title": "Agent {{agent.hostname}} Client: {{agent.site.client.name}}",
                "description": "This is an embed",
                "color": 15258703,
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "Field1",
                        "value": "Some value",
                        "inline": true
                    },

                        "value": "Another value",
                        "inline": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

=== ":material-code-json: JSON"

=== ":material-microsoft-teams: Microsoft Teams"

    [Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet)

    Microsoft Teams uses Office 365 Connectors for its incoming webhooks. The format for Teams is slightly more complex, allowing for potentially richer content.

    ```json
    {
        "@type": "MessageCard",
        "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
        "summary": "Issue 176715375",

            "activitySubtitle": "On Project XYZ",
            "activityImage": "https://teamsnodesample.azurewebsites.net/static/img/image5.png",
            "facts": [{
                "name": "Assigned to",
                "value": "Unassigned"
            }, {
                "name": "Due date",
                "value": "2016-08-29T04:31:32.993Z"
            }],
            "markdown": true
        }]
    }
    ```

=== ":material-slack: Slack"

    [Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)

    You can also send more complex messages with attachments, buttons, etc., by using Slackâ€™s rich messaging format.

    ```json
    {
        "text": "Hello, world! This is a line of text.\nAnd this is another one."
    }
    ```

=== ":simple-helpdesk: Ticketing System"

    [Zammad](../3rdparty_zammad.md)

    See above for how to open a ticket in Zammad with a webhook alert.
