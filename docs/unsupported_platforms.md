# Unsupported Install Platforms

## LXC Installs

[Read source](https://discord.com/channels/736478043522072608/959541976372502598)

Tactical RMM install on LXC: redis not starting.

### Symptoms

1. Agent exe install shows `Server error (503)` pop-up during the installation process.
2. Running the `troubleshoot_server.sh` reports `redis-server service isn't running (Tactical wont work without this)`.
3. `systemctl start redis` reports a problem:
   ```log
   "Job for redis-server.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
   See "systemctl status redis-server.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details."
   ```

Checking the systemctl:

```bash
`systemctl status redis-server.service`
```

Produces the following:

```log
"Job for redis-server.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status redis-server.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
root@rmm:/home/tactical# systemctl status redis-server.service

### The Fix

[(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49670211/failed-to-start-advanced-key-value-store-redis-server-service-control-process-e)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49670211/failed-to-start-advanced-key-value-store-redis-server-service-control-process-e)

Remove the server that comes with Tactical RMM:

```bash
apt-get --purge redis-server
```

Delete the `/var/log/redis` directory, then:

```bash
apt-get install redis-server
```

Then installation would look like this:

```log

```

Running the redis-server would shed more light on the issue:

```bash
/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

```log
*** FATAL CONFIG FILE ERROR (Redis 6.0.16) ***
Reading the configuration file, at line 260
>>> 'logfile /var/log/redis/redis-server.log'
Can't open the log file: No such file or directory'
```

Apparently, `/var/log/redis` has to be created manually:

```bash
mkdir /var/log/redis
chown -R redis:redis /var/log/redis
chmod -R u+rwX,g+rwX,u+rx /var/log/redis'
```

Run redis-server:

```bash
su -s /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf' redis
```

Confirm with:

```bash
ps ax|grep redis
```

All done! Thanks [FWG]SSOO
