# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the **_estimated_** release dates for major features that require significant development time and effort. However, smaller features and improvements will continue to be released in parallel on a flexible, as-needed basis, provided they don't involve substantial reworks.

Thanks go to all you [sponsors](sponsor.md#sponsor-with-stripe-or-paypal) it's your support that lets us continue to improve TRMM.
